                              Joy to the world was written in 1719 by British

                              finally settling on the 1848 version as a tune named "Antioch".

                              to music in 1850 and arranged in B-flat for a somber, but hopeful feeling.

                            O Tannenbaum is a German carol that translates to
                             "Oh Christmas tree." The tune, although not the lyrics,
                              was used as Florida, Michigan, Maryland, and lowa's state songs.
